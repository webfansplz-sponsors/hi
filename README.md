<h1 align='center'>Hi üëãüèº</h1>

It's nice to have you here and thanks for sponsoring!

Your sponsorships mean a lot to me as they support me in focusing on maintaining my projects and dreaming up new ideas instead of worrying much about money.

In this GitHub organization, I have private working-in-progress projects that sponsor reaching certain tiers and can have early access to them and give early feedback/requests, or even participate in decision-making, which might affect how and where the projects go.

When I feel one project is good enough to be publicized, I might transfer it to my main account [@webfansplz](https://github.com/webfansplz), or form a new organization with its collaborators, depending on the project. Either two ways, your name will be featured in the project's README as its Sponsors.

You may also find my projects that are already open-sourced on [this page](https://github.com/webfansplz).

[Sponsor me](https://github.com/sponsors/webfansplz) if you like my work and are interested in this program.
